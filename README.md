## My process

### Built with

- HTML5: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration indicates that this document utilizes HTML5.

- Responsive Design: The tag <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> suggests that the page is designed with both mobile and desktop compatibility in mind.

- External Fonts: Through Google Fonts (<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"/>), the web page employs the "Outfit" font.

- External CSS: The use of <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /> indicates that the CSS is separated into an external file.

- Images & Icons: The <img> tag is used to display the QR code, and the <link rel="icon" is used to set the website's favicon.

### What I learned

CSS Layout: Flexbox (display: flex) is used for center-aligning elements.

Color Management: The HSL color mode (e.g., hsl(212, 45%, 89%)) provides an intuitive way to adjust colors, where H stands for hue, S stands for saturation, and L stands for lightness.

Font Management: With Google Fonts, it's easy to access and employ a variety of fonts. Here, the "Outfit" font is used with multiple font weights.

Element Styling: Properties like border-radius (for rounded corners) and box-shadow (for shadow effects) are employed to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the webpage.

Responsive Font Sizes: Different font-size values in the CSS ensure that text appears appropriately sized across devices.

### Continued development

After continuous learning, I've found that to account for responsiveness across different devices or screen sizes, one can use media queries (@media queries) to further optimize CSS. This is an area I plan to focus on in the future
